# TICKET-CVX-006: High-Intent Lead Capture & Nurture Flow

**Type:** Feature  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Owner:** Lifecycle Marketing

## Background
The site currently offers a single conversion path (checkout). Users seeking more information or who need partner approval have no structured way to stay engaged, resulting in lost opportunities and reliance on one-touch conversions.

## Problem
- No gated assets or soft conversions (guides, checklists) to capture emails from high-fit but not-yet-ready buyers.  
- Lack of automated nurture sequence to educate and move leads toward checkout.  
- Support inbox becomes the fallback for questions, creating manual workload and slow response times.

## Proposed Solution
- Create a downloadable “Texas PLLC Formation Playbook” (board checklist, timeline, cost breakdown) accessible via modal or inline form.  
- Build a three-email nurture journey (Day 0, Day 3, Day 7) covering compliance tips, testimonials, and urgency triggers.  
- Add contextual lead capture modules at key drop-off points: after FAQ, within compliance sections, and as exit-intent on desktop (professional design, no pop-up spam).  
- Sync captured leads to CRM with persona tagging and progression stage (researching, ready-to-file, board support needed).  
- Provide optional SMS reminder opt-in for high-intent prospects.

## Success Metrics
- Capture ≥ 15% of unique visitors into nurture within first 60 days.  
- Achieve ≥ 12% nurture-to-checkout visit conversion rate.  
- Reduce support-ticket volume related to “What’s included?” by 20%.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Download form collects name, email, profession, and readiness timeframe with explicit consent checkbox.  
- Emails are brand-aligned, mobile-optimized, and include clear CTA to schedule consult or start checkout.  
- Exit-intent pattern uses fade-in modal with dismiss option; no display on small mobile devices.  
- CRM receives lead data with correct tags; automation triggers verified end-to-end.  
- Compliance review completed for email content (CAN-SPAM, privacy).  
- Reporting dashboard built to track download conversion, open/click rates, and assisted revenue.

## Dependencies
- Content team for playbook creation.  
- CRM/marketing automation platform (HubSpot, Customer.io, etc.).  
- Legal/privacy review for data capture and SMS consent language.

## Notes
- Test multiple guide headlines (compliance checklist vs launch roadmap) via A/B test.  
- Align messaging with TICKET-CVX-005 output to avoid duplication.
