# TICKET-CVX-003: Verified Social Proof & Trust Signal System

**Type:** Feature  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Priority:** High  
**Owner:** Brand Marketing

## Background
Testimonials are text-only with limited credibility markers, and there are no visual trust badges (board seals, partner logos, press mentions). Professional services buyers demand independent validation before checkout, especially when compliance risk is high.

## Problem
- Testimonials lack photos, credentials, or verification badges, reducing perceived authenticity.  
- No display of licensing board approvals, partner associations, or professional memberships.  
- Checkout and landing pages do not surface review platform ratings or third-party badges, weakening trust at key conversion stages.

## Proposed Solution
- Collect and publish rich testimonials (headshots, practice type, city, before/after outcome) and flag them as verified with consent.  
- Curate a trust badge strip featuring Texas licensing boards, professional associations, and payment security icons.  
- Embed rotating case-study cards highlighting quantifiable wins (e.g., “Filed in 34 hours, accepted first submission”).  
- Add review platform widgets (Google, Trustpilot) with live star ratings and link to profile.  
- Ensure social proof modules appear near CTAs on hero, pricing, checkout sidebar, and Final CTA.

## Success Metrics
- +15% lift in checkout completion rate (profession pages → checkout).  
- +20% increase in testimonial module interaction (expand, swipe) within 30 days.  
- +10% improvement in Net Promoter Score (post-purchase survey) due to trust reinforcement.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Minimum of six testimonials live at launch, representing all four personas.  
- Each testimonial includes headshot, full name (or initial if required), credential, city, and formation date.  
- Trust badge strip passes responsive layout checks and includes alt text.  
- Review widget updates dynamically (no stale data).  
- Checkout page displays at least two proof elements above the fold on mobile.  
- Legal approves use of logos and testimonials; consent forms stored.

## Dependencies
- Customer Success team for testimonial sourcing and consent.  
- Design support for badge strip and testimonial layout.  
- Legal review for brand/logo usage.

## Notes
- Consider leveraging structured data (Review schema) to boost SEO.  
- Schedule quarterly refresh to keep social proof current.
