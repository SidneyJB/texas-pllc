# TICKET-CVX-002: Competitor Comparison & Pricing Proof Layer

**Type:** Feature  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Priority:** High  
**Owner:** Marketing

## Background
Visitors evaluating PLLC formation services often comparison-shop against LegalZoom, Incfile, and local attorneys. The current pages explain inclusions but do not quantify differentiation, leaving price-sensitive users without a clear ROI argument for the $749 package.

## Problem
- High-intent users lack a transparent line-by-line comparison demonstrating total cost of ownership versus competitors.  
- There is no visual articulation of the 48-hour SLA, profession-specific expertise, or included board guidance relative to alternatives.  
- Absence of a guarantee badge with supporting legal copy reduces perceived risk mitigation.

## Proposed Solution
- Create a structured comparison table (complete vs competitors vs DIY) highlighting speed, inclusions, board compliance handling, and true cost after upsells.  
- Add a “Why Professionals Choose Us” section with quantified outcomes (average days saved, revision rate, compliance success).  
- Embed microcopy linking the guarantee terms and SLA policy for transparency.  
- Include downloadable PDF/print-friendly version for stakeholders (partners, practice owners) to review offline.  
- Integrate social proof quotes near the table that specifically reference switching from competitors.

## Success Metrics
- +20% increase in scroll depth completion of pricing section within 30 days.  
- +12% lift in clicks on primary CTA originating from pricing/comparison modules.  
- Reduced pricing objections in support chats/emails by 25% (qualitative tracking).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Comparison table renders responsively (stacked cards on mobile) and meets WCAG contrast guidelines.  
- At least three competitor rows populated with sourced data (citations documented).  
- Guarantee copy links to detailed SLA modal/page with plain-language explanation.  
- PDF export retains branding and is ≤ 2 pages.  
- Analytics events fire when users interact with comparison elements (viewed, expanded, downloaded).

## Dependencies
- Data validation from Legal/Operations team to ensure competitive claims are accurate.  
- Analytics instrumentation per TICKET-CVX-009.

## Notes
- Consider rounding competitor pricing to nearest dollar but include footnotes for transparency.  
- Use plain language to avoid sounding combative; focus on clarity and professionalism.
