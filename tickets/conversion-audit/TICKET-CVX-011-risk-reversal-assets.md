# TICKET-CVX-011: Risk Reversal & Compliance Assurance Assets

**Type:** Feature  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Owner:** Legal & Marketing

## Background
Guarantee messaging exists but is brief. Buyers in regulated professions need explicit reassurance that filings will meet board requirements and that there is a safety net if issues occur.

## Problem
- Guarantee details are not documented in an easily consumable format.  
- No visibility into operational metrics (on-time filing rate, revision handling, customer satisfaction).  
- Lack of FAQ coverage specific to risk scenarios (missed filing window, board rejection).

## Proposed Solution
- Publish a dedicated “Guarantee & Compliance Assurance” page with plain-language explanations of SLA, refund policy, and escalation process.  
- Include operational metrics (historical on-time percentage, average filing duration, revision success rate) updated monthly.  
- Add video or infographic explaining the filing process and safeguards.  
- Create FAQ module focused on risk scenarios and how the team resolves them.  
- Link guarantee content prominently from hero, pricing, and checkout.

## Success Metrics
- ≥ 10% increase in guarantee section engagement (clicks/scroll depth).  
- ≥ 5% reduction in pre-purchase support tickets about refunds or compliance worries.  
- Maintain on-time filing SLA ≥ 95% with publicly displayed transparency.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Guarantee page published with accessible language and downloadable PDF summary.  
- Metrics automatically pull from internal dashboard or are updated via documented monthly process.  
- Video/visual asset professionally produced and captioned.  
- FAQ covers at least six risk scenarios with clear guidance.  
- Link tracking implemented to measure engagement from hero, pricing, and checkout.  
- Legal signs off on guarantees and disclaimers.

## Dependencies
- Operations data source for SLA metrics.  
- Design/video resources for visual asset production.  
- Analytics instrumentation per TICKET-CVX-009.

## Notes
- Consider including customer quote or case study about a resolved issue to build credibility.  
- Ensure copy aligns with actual operational capabilities to avoid compliance risk.
