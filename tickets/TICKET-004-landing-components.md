**Type:** Story  
**Priority:** P1 - High  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Sprint:** MVP Launch  
**Status:** Done

## Description
Build the reusable component library for landing pages following the 10-section blueprint from the PRD.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Hero component with CTA
- [x] Problem section component
- [x] Solution section component
- [x] Benefits section component
- [x] How It Works component (3-step visual)
- [x] Social Proof component (testimonials placeholder)
- [x] Pricing Table component
- [x] Guarantee section component
- [x] FAQ component (accordion style)
- [x] Final CTA component
- [x] All components accept props for profession-specific content
- [x] Components are responsive

## Technical Details
- Create components in `components/landing/` directory
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Make components flexible and reusable
- Use placeholder content initially

## Dependencies
- TICKET-001 (Next.js project)
- TICKET-003 (Basic layout)

## Notes
Focus on structure and functionality. Content can be refined later. For MVP, one profession page is enough, but build components to be reusable.
